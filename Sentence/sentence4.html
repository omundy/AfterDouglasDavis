actually pronounce the "w" whereas I tend to onlypronounce the "a," as does Alex) and, yet, I say this withsome apprehension because Alex is Canadian even though Ilove all Canadians and truly enjoy their dual nature asFrench and British (my two favorite places, with the UnitedStates somewhere in between) but some Southerners look uponCanada with distrust, perhaps because of its reputation asa holding place for slaves that escaped the tyranny of thesomewhat ignorant rulers of the South (not to offend anySoutherners or racists, wink, wink) but I think that it isa good thing when a United States citizen can truly proclaimtheir love for another country with a much smaller populationand with a reputation of harboring people escaping for theVietnam War draft, which is exactly something I think thatJenni would do because she is such a cool person, but I amgoing to have to add one person that owns the world afterAlex, and that would be Dr. Parker, my high school principalwhose stern look and strict rules made the school a muchbetter place in which to exist free from the fights anddrugs common to so much of society so I, Joseph MichaelRozier have stated my philosophy on life and the Art ofMotorcylce Maintenance (wait, I guess I didn't actually dothat, but it would have made one fantabulous addition tothis miniscule phrase on the seemingly infinite sentence)and, though I have never read Zen and that Art, I have seenit (with a quick reference to Chris Kelley, who mistakenlybelieves that empty space is not Chemistry when it actuallyis because the lack of something is just as signficant asthe presence of something in my view) so, I, Joseph MichaelRozier, alternatively known at different times in my lifeas Jo-Jo, Joey, Rainman, Junebug, a Nuclear Powered Friend,a nerd, and a great storyteller (although I don't know ifAugust Hammonds was actually serious when she said that, Iactually think that it was a criticism now that I am thinkingabout thinking about it) and, no, I did not include any neator original things to this sentence such as symbols,pictures, or sounds, but I did pour my heart (that is, theheart of Joseph Michael Rozier) into making a tribute to oneof my bestest friends in the whole wide world, Jenni Brewerwhich I hope that she enjoys so this is the end of my phrase,which I hope was grammatically correct, although I am afraidthat I may have ended a part with a preposition, which Iknow is illegal so that is the end of my speech and I shallnow say bye, although I am not ending the sentence so, I Joseph Michael Rozier, am sorry, but I must make the following addition to theabove stated phrase about my hero, Jennie Brewer:  justto make sure no extreme right-wing people hate her and noextreme left-wing people get their hopes up, the part whereI was talking about liking Canada and that it had a reputation of draft dodgers, I said that Ithought that Jenni would do that, I was referring to liking Canada, and notdodging the draft because I know that Jenni is a great, All-American person whowould blindly do what the government told her to do, no matter what theconsequences (yeah, right) so she would never dodge the draft, but I have afeeling she would love Canada, which was the correction Iwas trying to make so that no one would understand my friendJenni and that, my friends, is the rest of the story (in a way) Hey, I'm not pushing you awar from me, I'm pulling me closer to myself So Help Me GOD!

find her number in a round about sort of way, at which point I decided to get to it and I typed 'boarding school' (because thats where her adress is, a girls boarding school in PA, where she is a teacher or faculty member of some sort) and what came up was not anything useful but instead it was this, this maddening setence, and of course I decided I had to be a part of it, and looked for someplace where I could submit something, only to discover that the only place I could write something was is a little box which was not quite at the end of the sentence, which I found odd, surely,

all great epics do, mind you-I figured it would be much more in the spirit of this mess and therefore decided to go on with it--not very creative, I guess, and, to tell you the truth, I have my

attracts people to this and to a contribution in this large communal repodepository is a need to assimilate a part of themselves into an expression and creation of the larger society which I don't

i wandered past the shattered husks of former health as they lay in the alley and glanced at a hooker on her knees paying off a cop in trade; stevie and i had arranged the meet, and i was hungry for the money and it seemedthat the vials were burning where they lay against my leg; but when they caught meslipping them into my mouth to do a handoff to stevie by kissing him long and deep, passing him the vial with my tongue, pretending not to notice the feel of his tongueagainst mine, pretending i couldn't taste his fetid breath; then they took me down to the station and worked me over until they were bored then tossed me in with the dragqueens;there was one, who called herself "jackie o'nasty" and she was in for stabbing a man;i asked her why she did it;<p>she said "well, there we were, my man and i walking along on our way overto Pierre's -- you know that bar over there by the cinema near the Zone -- andwe were on our way over there even though the acts there are really nothing compared to what they used to be when Miss Virginia Ham was lip synching there, i mean,the kids today just don't have it; when i was first coming into drag, i made myown outfits and it was all a craft, an art; today these young kids just buytheir own; and i just *don't* want to know <em>where</em> they get the money;probably into drugs; i never made that kind of money when i was hooking; but thewhole management thing got on my nerves so i just left that bad boy in the dustand went freelance and started flagging down truckers, standing on the corner and waving at them; and i know i'm not looking mighty real now, since the cops toremy outfit like this (those brutes) but i was looking so very real that mostof those phobic good old boys never knew that i give good head because a girl likeme knows what a man like him wants;<p>"but anyways, i was explaining how i got here; so there we were walking over to Pierre's Barand my man is wearing his stonewall 25 gay pride t-shirt that we got at the dance on the USS Independence and suddenly these two cute adorable college boys in their frat shirts start hollering at us, calling my man a fag-boy; well, we ignored them, after all, a lady has her dignity; but they started following us and calling out the mostdreadful things to us; and just as we were getting close to the busy part of thestreet, they ran up behind us and knocked him down and asked why i was hanging outwith a fag-boy like that; and, well, i may not look it now, but i was a wrestlerin high school and i used to box until i realized that i just couldn't cut it asa butch boy; so i decked the one closest to me and when the other one pulled a knife, i just took it away from him and slapped him upside the head so very hardthat it knocked him out cold; the first one had gotten up by this time and wasrunning back over to me with hatred in his eyes, but i knocked him out too; after all, a girl has to protect her man, doesn't she, now; but that's what the cops couldn't understandabout it because when they showed up they were nice and friendly until they realized thati wasn't a real girl, and it's just a little piece of flesh but it upset them mightily;and so they took me in and worked me over and that's why i'm here,"<p>i looked her up and down and realized that that she-male was ballsier than i would've beenin that situation; so i let her live even though she had seen my face;<p>everyone else in the station who had seen me wasn't so lucky; including the old secretary who was filing my mug shot;<p>i was out on the street again and dreaming of my home among the fellow water-mammals; sometimes, it was tough to be a were-human; sometimes i wished i was just a dolphinlike my siblings and pod-mates;<hr> </a> </em><hr>i dreamed of a !kung tribesman roaming the urban jungle, and of astone-faced urban homeboy roving the african continent; i dreamed oflovers calling out in passion, and the cold chill that follows hearingsomeone call out a name that isn't yours as you grunt and scream yourway to an aborted climax; i dreamed of the children in the gutters,calling out for a piece of bread, selling their bodies to those whoslice the flesh from their bones trying to make contact with someone,<em>anyone</em>; i dreamed of butchers in dachau deboning live womenand the men who volunteered for "aviation" experiments where they wereleft in icy water (simulating a pilot stranded in the atlantic) untilthey died, or who were placed in atmospheric chambers that wereevacuated until they died from lack of oxygen or from the lack ofatmosphere; i dreamed of whipped dogs whimpering in the night; idreamed of bondage in a microgravity environment and it was the mosterotic dream of my life as a man was tied and sodomized and then istood in front of him and slid his member into my vagina and rode himin the spinning no-end-up world of orbit until we both screamed; idreamed i knew the reason cats scream in the night like children andangels are never seen in the alleys occupied by hookers on their kneespaying off cops drunk on power; i dreamed i saw the naked face of loveand it was scarred with experience; i dreamed i saw innocence lost andthe terror of knowing what's going to happen next; <p>i sit in the hospital waiting room, blood flowing freely from myskull; it drips into my eyes and i shake my head, spattering the wallswith red;

filledwith simple toys to keep our minds off of the shit beneath,they struggle to forget, to erase the true world from their memory, and many do, living a lie in a world they created for themselves from their own imagination, and now they arestuck in that fucking limbo of false happiness frolicking intheir own shit,                                             But I am not as

and I go on, and maybeone day I will triumph but probably not because we are all fooled by those simple toys and I eventually will stop to play, and when that happens I will have lost my way, all myprogress erased, and my one true hope gone forever,Please dont leave me hope, I may be imperfect in every waybut I am still trying to get through, to reach my apex ofreality, and I will not let

PERIOD</H2></CENTER><P><P><FONT SIZE=5>Is there a point at writing a sentence without one was the question I asked myself when I looked at "The World First (and Longest) Collaborative Sentence" a few days ago: this sentence goes on and on, upon more than 300 K, and without a single period in it (actually there is because hackers found a way to force periods into the program), but it is not only the longest sentence on this side of the Galaxy, it's also a mirror of the Internet population as of today: most of the sentence is in English but you can find bits in German, Polish, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and other languages I could not even recognize, so it's global all right but not only, the content of the Sentence itself gives a very good sociological view of Net users: as Technical Conceptor Gary Welz puts it "In some sense we can regard the Sentence as a snapshot of the Internet community at the present time - widely dispersed, fascinated with the new technology, rabidly vocal, recklessly adolescent and shamelessly uncontrolled" many contributors are writing about themselves, putting links to their own pages, plenty are playing with the technical possibilities of HTML writing to put bold, big characters into the Sentence to break its monotony, some are writing off their phantasms as they would on a graffiti wall, many are taking this Sentence as a game and take up the challenge of writing on and on what goes through their mind just to be part of history; because this sentence is now part of history, ever since its conceptor, writer and first generation video artist (back in the late 60's) Douglas Davis started it on the net in early December 94 "Actually it was meant to stay there until February 15, 95 but the Sentence was already doing three miles long at that time and I just felt it did not belong to me anymore, when I started, I wanted to shock the world with its own brilliance and involvement with serious issues of communication, expression, art, literature, and even grammar"  insists Davis, "not so much on the megalomaniac side of net users"; so it goes on and on, in June alone, the Host computer of the Sentence recorded more than 50,000 hits, it's impossible to know how many people made a contribution to the Sentence, but Douglas Davis guesses that it goes into "thousands of people", and it will grow even more, especially in Asia, since the Sentence is one of the attraction of the Kwangju Biennale in Korea which is held in mid-september, one of the contributor, Eugene Schwartz, who is a famous collector of Contemporary art, a long time admirer of Douglas's work and has purchased many works Douglas did, even bought a disc with the sentence, the pictures, the sound and the video thst
