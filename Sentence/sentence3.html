The original idea was to explore the way meanings were created by the New York Times through the use of language, image and format.However, I became very interested in creating something that had a life, something that was out in the world, and somethingthat offered a solution to the way that I felt that modern news media were shaping the identity of the planet. This shiftin interest became apparent when I moved beyond a formal analysis of the New York Times and began to come to understand the deeper function of the newspaper and the problems involved with this aspect of the newspaper. I began to see the newspaperas an object that had come to serve a function as a definer of social realities. We all look to the newspaper to come to understand the accepted behaviors, the social structure, and the limits of our position in our society. These functions were once the responsibility of the tribal shaman, the priest,the bible etc. Today, we must rely upon the mega-corporations, which produce and control news media, to fulfill this sacred task and this realization is what inspired my senior project. Itwas my intention to produce an online newspaper that would offer a more humanistic, and thus more realistic, picture ofour social reality by allowing each person the ability tosubmit there own news stories. The form of this online newspaper was an adaptation of earlier studies of the construction of meanings in which I took the contents of the New York Times and fused it with the vernacular of some common consumer products. It was an attempt to show very directly how I felt about the New York Times and its role as a consumer product owned by news conglomerates. It was my intention at the beginning of this project to comment on the connections and conflicts I found betweenthe production of unbiased news and the running of a business, but decided to reach further down inside the various levels of functions, of modern newspapers, to the social reality issue. It was my intention to offer a solution to the problems that I uncovered and the internet was the medium that offered me that chance. It is a place where I can have my voice, were I havethe power to invent and reinvent who I am or what I think, on adaily basis. In an overmediated world in which the rich and powerfulare the only ones with the ability to have a voice, the internetstands alone as the only mass medium to which the “people” have access. My newspaper will continue to change and evolve as time passes, and therein lies its beauty. It is a piece that has a life, that allows you a voice.        Senior Project Spring 1995Mark McPherson========================<A HREF="http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~markmac/index.html"><H3>My NEWSPAGE</H3></A> I'm going to write this sentence, and it won't enclude a period since periods are not allowed, however if they were I would put one in Well I am contemplating whether or not I'm going to pass my final lab exam does the state of the universe really depend on this <i> <font size="+2">and i just can't express how interesting this all feels almost as if there are hundreds of us in a room together and the noise of our voices is a</i> <i><font size="+4">rhythm</i> <i><font size="-2">that roars louder than any single voice yet  we are all speaking in ONE SINGLE VOICE</i> hi, i'm Jamie , and i'm DILLY(Chad ), nathan (Tommy Boy), Valmeyer is cool,            all we know is all we are His sandwich pulled itself apart and star worms flew in a million directions at once.

Hey from Houston, Tx. I sat down to write something that would change the world. Then I realized by the time I finished this the world would already have changed on its own.  A thought came very soon there after may be it's not change that is important maybe it is growth.  Change is inevitable  growth is the option. But then who gets to decide what is good or bad growth? I think I'll have another beer and grow some more.

This is the ship of pearls poets feign-Sails the unshadowed main.The venturous bark that flingsOn the sweet summer wind it's purple wings.In gulfs enchanted where the siren singsAnd the coral reefs lie bare-Where the cold sea maids rise to sun their streaming hair.Build thee more stately mansions Oh my soulAs the swift seasons rollLet thy low vaulted pastCover thee with a dome more vastTill thou at length are free-Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea.one of my favorites		Stolen from R.L.S. by M.
